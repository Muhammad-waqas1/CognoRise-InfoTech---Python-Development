# CognoRise InfoTech - Python Development Internship

Welcome to the **Python Development Internship** repository! This repository contains all the tasks and projects completed during my Python development internship at **CognoRise InfoTech**. Each task is designed to enhance Python programming skills, with a focus on practical applications.

---

## **Task Overview:**

### **Task 1: Calculator App**
- **Description**: A basic calculator for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It prompts the user for two numbers and the desired operation.
- **Skills**: User Input, Conditionals, Arithmetic Operations

### **Task 2: Password Generator**
- **Description**: A password generator that creates strong, random passwords based on user-defined length and complexity. The program uses a combination of characters to ensure password strength.
- **Skills**: Random Module, String Manipulation

### **Task 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**
- **Description**: A classic game where the user competes against the computer. The game implements logic to determine the winner based on user and computer selections.
- **Skills**: Random Selection, Game Logic, Conditionals

### **Task 4: Hangman Game**
- **Description**: A hangman word-guessing game where the player must guess the word before too many incorrect attempts. The game features word selection, user input validation, and win/loss conditions.
- **Skills**: Loops, Conditionals, String Manipulation

### **Task 5: Dice Rolling Simulator**
- **Description**: A simple dice rolling simulator that allows users to specify the number of sides on a die and simulate rolling it multiple times.
- **Skills**: Random Number Generation, Loops, User Input

### **Task 6: Countdown Timer**
- **Description**: A graphical countdown timer using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to set a custom countdown time and provides an intuitive user interface for time management.
- **Skills**: Tkinter GUI, Time Management

### **Task 7: QR Code Encoder/Decoder**
- **Description**: A project to encode and decode QR codes using Python libraries. The tool generates QR codes for various data types and decodes them back into readable text or links.
- **Skills**: Image Processing, QR Code Generation

### **Task 8: Sudoku Solver**
- **Description**: A Sudoku solver that uses algorithmic techniques to solve Sudoku puzzles programmatically. The program takes an incomplete grid as input and outputs the solution.
- **Skills**: Backtracking Algorithm, Matrix Manipulation

## **Purpose of Internship:**
The goal of this internship is to expand knowledge of Python by working on practical and real-world applications. It encourages a hands-on approach to learning, offering a range of tasks from basic arithmetic operations to game development and complex problem-solving techniques.

---

## **How to Run the Projects:**
Each project can be run independently. Navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the Python script. Ensure that required libraries are installed (e.g., Tkinter for the countdown timer, qrcode and OpenCV for the QR code project).
